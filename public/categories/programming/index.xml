      <description>I was tasked to create ethereum smart contracts in my previous job.
the library most recommended by other developers to create smart contracts was hardhat.
to create and debug the smart contracts, I developed them using test-driven-development methods. The tests gave me a way to print out and inspect variables.
just as I was done with the development I read somewhere that hardhat has a console.log() utility. You import it with import hardhat/console.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new category of posts called &amp;ldquo;Code Snippets&amp;rdquo; where I share code I find interesting.
In this first installment is a simple code snippet I originally wrote in Powershell to scan a local port continuously and do something when the port is found:
function deploy(): if ( port_exists(port) ): do_something() else: deploy() deploy() Recursion has been a hard concept for me to put into practice and this served as a good introduction to it.</description>
