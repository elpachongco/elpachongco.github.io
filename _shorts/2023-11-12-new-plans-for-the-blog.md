I recently saw [Gwern's blog](https://gwern.net/). The design and content are great. I want my blog to be like this â€” a page in the internet that has its own personality and feels _crafted_. Currently, It's just a dump of my thoughts and it's using the default Jekyll theme. Though I like the look of it, I want to add more quality of life features to it while keeping it static.
