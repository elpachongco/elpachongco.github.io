[ ](https://uses.tech/)I was looking at [uses.tech website](https://uses.tech/). I wondered how I can have an animated favicon because this is probably the first time I saw one. 

Then I came accross this: [an arcade game played in the favicon](http://www.p01.org/defender_of_the_favicon/). How cool is that!
