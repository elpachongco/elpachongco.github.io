- Mouse and keyboard problem. u end up with hurt wrist

Vim removes the need to use the mouse when editing text. 

- Editor problem. Every new editor, you need to learn. The solution is VIM. 

No one text editor can do the all the job you need it to do. We almost always
end up using different editors for different language or ecosystem. VSCode for
JS, Android studio for Java/Kotlin etc. By learning Vim, you will save some
time getting familiar with the shortcuts most of these editors use. There are
avaialble extensions that let you use Vim keys in their editors.

- Things I can only do in VIM:



- How to start

To start, install Vim and run `vimtutor` from the command line.
