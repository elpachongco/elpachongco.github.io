I was hired by a team of data scientists developing a product from their
university research. They're funded by the government and partnered with their
university.

Our core team is composed of 4 people. I'm the one in charged of programming the
product. Our project leader is a Cs doctorate and a professor in the university
so the environment of what you'd expect from the govt and the academia -- most
of the time Buzzwords?. Especially that the project is focused on blockchain
tech. It’s hard to be surrounded by non-programming people (but otherwise
technical) speculating on the technology.

I was hired February of 2022, and it’s now been one year.

- I met my goal.
-
- Reading x styleguide is great. 
- x by example is the fastest way to get coding if you have prior programming
  experience
- Testing is king if the project is complex. (Django)
