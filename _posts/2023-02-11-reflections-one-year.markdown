I was hired by a team of data scientists developing a product from their
university research. They're funded by the government and partnered with their
university.

Our core team is composed of 4 people. I'm the one in charged of programming the
product. Our project leader is a Cs doctorate and a professor in the university
so the environment of what you'd expect from the govt and the academia -- most
of the time Buzzwords?. Especially that the project is focused on blockchain
tech. It’s hard to be surrounded by non-programming people (but otherwise
technical) speculating on the technology.

I was hired February of 2022, and it’s now been one year.

- I met my goal.
-
- Reading x styleguide is great. 
- x by example is the fastest way to get coding if you have prior programming
  experience
- Testing is king if the project is complex. (Django)




I posted a blog on August 6, 2021 stating that I want to get a job before april
2022.  During that time, I was creating projects so I will have something in my
resume.  I was reading up on what people in the Tech industry have to say about
landing a job without a degree and having a collection of projects that
demonstrate my skills to potential employers.

It was a good advice. By February of 2022, I found a job.  The interview went
well, I demonstrated some of my projects and one of their programmers asked me
technical questions. IIRC, the questions were about programming best practices,
What I do when I can't solve a programming problem. I was able to answer the
questions well, and I was hired. 

I work as a programmer in one of the teams with an office headquarters at a
university.  The environment is mostly academia and with the project being
government-funded, I also have to deal with how the government handles its
projects. 

In the office, I get to meet different kinds of people. It's great to be
surrounded by people smarter than me, especially programmers. I can ask them
advice on technical topics and most of the time that's when I learn new things.

The project is a renewable energy trading platform based on blockchain.  It's
been under development for a year now. The development of this project taught
me a lot of things as a programmer. I wrote code from low level hardware code,
to frontend react code.

- TDD is great
For complex projects such as our backend server (django), test-driven
devleopment helped a lot.  I can't imagine how much time i saved by creating
tests to implement features in such a complex system.  Compared to just using
`print()` like I'm used to. Now, If i'm going to work on a project where
printing will be impractical or impossible (like solidity) to do, 

- Templates are great For the frontend, we used an open source template written
  in react and material-ui. This helped the project progress fast.  I think
  it's better to spend my time modifying the defaults of the template instead
  of starting from scatch.
