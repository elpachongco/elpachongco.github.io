AIM: Make the hobby programmer reader realize that they need a process.

I've been developing applications for around 3 years now. Mostly just for fun, and for my personal use. But now, with a new job, I have to work with a team.

In this job, I noticed myself making a lot of small mistakes repeatedly: Forgetting to push commits before asking for code review, forgetting to set a variable to False before pushing, or outright forgetting to test before pushing.

A kind coworker, understandably, probably got tired of me making these small mistakes and offered help. We did a one-on-one chat, and he asked some questions. Basically felt like being debugged.

The most important part of our conversation was when he asked me to outline what I do when I work, from start to finish. So I thought it through, outlined my rough steps when working, and came up with the steps on the fly by thinking of what I always do.

I'm telling this because he asked me if I just came up with it on the fly. And that's when the realization hit. I already have the ideal workflow, and I haven't written it down.

So we wrote it down, and turned the steps into checklist items. Saved this file as 'workflow.md'. This file contains a simple checklist of the ideal process:

```
- [ ] When starting a task, create a Trello card.
- [ ] After creation of a card, create a Slack thread.
```

When I start a new task, I open this file and go through it one by one. By following a document, and not relying on memory or instinct, mistakes are lessened.

But the best part is that this can be enhanced. Whenever we make a mistake, we ask ourselves, is this a mistake that could have been prevented by a better process? If yes, we revise the workflow file.

For example, a task I worked on required a near 





I had a realization. I've never actually been as serious and disciplined as the people I now work with. 

As I started working in my new job, I realized that I have the tendency to be careless and forgetful. This made me feel lacking. A coworkers offered me a solution, which I also find brilliant - a checklist.

From the questions, he understood that 

I felt like a toddler in a room of smart people. Granted, I'm the youngest one in the team.

When something unmanageable comes in, you'll rely on process.

In an aim to improve, we realized that I lacked a process. As someone who is used to making programs for my own use, I didn't need a process. That's what I thought, until I started working with a bigger group of developers.

There were multiple issues

1. Tendency to forget things
2. Getting overwhelmed
3. Making a lot of mistakes

After some questions about understanding how I work, we realized there's no process to my work. It's all chaos.

What's the process

* Ask questions
*

What to consider in the process

* What are your flaws? (e.g. being careless), then fadd to your process a coping mechanism (e.g. do a triple check)
