AIM: Make the hobby programmer reader realize that they need a process.

As I started working in my new job, I, with the help of my team, realized that I lacked a process. 

I've been developing applications for a couple of years now. But in this new job I felt that the code I'm producing is not up to the standards of my co-workers. 
It's shameful. 
They're all professional.

In an aim to improve, we realized that I lacked a process. As someone who is used to making programs for my own use, I didn't need a process. That's what I thought, until I started working with a bigger group of developers.

There were multiple issues

1. Tendency to forget things
2. Getting overwhelmed
3. Making a lot of mistakes

After some questions about understanding how I work, we realized there's no process to my work. It's all chaos.

What's the process

* Ask questions
*

What to consider in the process

* What are your flaws? (e.g. being careless), then add to your process a coping mechanism (e.g. do a triple check)
