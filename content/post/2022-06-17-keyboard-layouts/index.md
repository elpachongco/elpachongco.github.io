title: Prevent pinky strain caused by typing all day
draft: false

Typing all day makes my pinky sore. This is how I got rid of it:

[Superuser.com: How do I hit the “Ctrl” key without straining my pinky?](https://superuser.com/a/317593)

I press both ctrl keys with the edge of my palm. It's perfect; I don't have to
stretch my pinkies, and my fingers don't have to move away from where they're
supposed to be. 

Only downside is that this technique won't work flat keyboards like the ones
laptops have. For those, I use an ANSI layout with a few modifications: 

- CapsLock key is remapped to OS key 
	Reasons why I do it this way:
	- I use the OS key more often than the caps lock key. 
	- I use the CTRL key too much (emacs, terminal) that this placement
	  will still hurt my pinky

- And a bottom row layout where the control and alt keys are beside the space
  bar respectively:

	```
	| CapsLock (optional) | alt | ctrl | space bar | ctrl | alt | 
	```

	This allows me to use my thumb for both the alt and ctrl keys which is
	powerful for me. 

These techniques and layouts here mostly focus on making ctrl and alt keys very
accessible because I use them a lot (the shell, emacs). 

That's it. It solves my problem, it works for me, and it's simple enough.

- learned programming

When I learned programming, I had to use the keyboard for most of my work.
Compared to what i do with the computer previously, programming involved using
the keyboard all day. 

- Using  keyboard for long periods hurt SOME of my fingers

I was not used to this method of computing which made my fingers hurt after a
day of doing practice programming.

- Why is it only some? There must be something wrong with the way I use my
  keyboards. I don't want some of them to hurt, I want all of them.

The way it hurt, only some of my fingers were affected. Most of them were fine
by the end of the day. I figured I might be doing something wrong with the way
I type. My pursuit of finding the best keyboard layout began and here are my
findings.

## TWO Keyboard layouts

The first course of action would be to pick a keyboard layout.

I figured I wanted to be mobile. I wanted to be able to program even if I have
no access to my home setup or I don't have my keyboard with me. This rules out
the possibility of using a different keyboard layout than qwerty.

In the end, I decided to learn two layouts: one for regular keyboards (those
with higher keys), and for laptop and laptop-like keyboards (those with almost
flat keys).

It works for me. I haven't encoutnered much confusion with the layouts EXCEPT
when I try to use both layouts on the same keyboard (i.e. switching desktop
environments)


- I make my self accustomed to both 
- No problems encountered yet when switching layouts except when I use the SAME
  keyboard for both layouts (e.g. switching desktop environment from i3 to xfce)


## Raised key keyboards


- Tried remapping caps lock to control
- something 



## Flat key keyboards

- Use ansi layout except control, alt  is switched places
- OS key on caps lock
- alt and ctrl reachable by the thumb




Hi. Starting today, I'll start this blog as a personal log of everything that I
want to say. I mainly plan to add my opinions on some topics that interest me
(I'll stay away from rants) and helpful things that I learn and encounter as I
go.

Since I am coming into the computer industry without formal education on the
topic, this blog could also be helpful for me to getting a job as one of my
projects that employers can refer to. And if I do succeed in getting a job, I
hope other people who would be in the same situation as me can refer to my blog
as a reference.

I'm currently 20 years old, and my plan is to get hired when I turn 21. This is
a deadline I imposed on myself that I'd give myself time to learn the things
necessary to get hired. I don't really have to have a job but I aim to have at
least a source of income by that time.

Now I say that but I still feel like I want a job even if by that time I have a
proper source of income (business or  something) because I think the "developer
experience" is not complete without the interaction with other developers who I
can learn from and v./v.. I watched some of the google talks and they make it a
point that success mostly comes from good communication which I think I still
lack. I still don't have any experience on working on other projects with other
developers. Not to say that it's the only solution because I also think that I
can achieve the same by contributing to other open source projects. I'll just
have to see for myself but those are the things that I'm considering.
