title: Blog redesign checklist
---
I recently posted this: [New plans for the blog](https://elpachongco.github.io/shorts/2023-11-12-new-plans-for-the-blog.htm)

To summarize, I'll be redesigning this blog.

In this article, I'll list the things that I want my blog to have.

## Must haves

- [ ] User-clickable anchors for each post's headers (h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)
  - [ ] If possible, must highlight if scrolled or by clicking table of contents.
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Table of contents for each post
  - [ ] Must be visible while scrolling. If possible, should also highlight current section.
- [ ] /shorts/ - of course
- [ ] Last updated information
- [ ] Retain StaticCMS. It's very convinient.
- [ ] A `draft` indicator, Gwern-style. Since I'll be using the blog as my personal notes website, every change I make to it WILL be pushed, even drafts.
- [ ] Code snippets must have a built-in header for filename.
- [ ]  Static site search (like papermod)
- [ ] Captions for each image

## Optional

- [ ] A way to manage and view history of updates of an article (since it's managed in git). E.g. arrow buttons to navigate history of the article.
- [ ] Comment section. (Discuss? Bhread?)
