Note: this is an unorganized, low-effort rant of how I feel about Facebook and how the Philippines' depends too much on it.

## Public Information Office

In the Philippines, updates for most cities will come from the city's own "Public Information Office" which posts updates on their Facebook page. They do not have their own website. Sometimes I open Facebook on my phone with the intent to catch up on information but when the site loads, my attention is immediately drawn towards the news feed. I end up scrolling for 5-15 minutes, sometimes causing me to forget why I even opened the site. 

## Crucial information + FB algorithm = dangerous

Facebook is not a news platform but because it tends to be the fastest way to see updates, it kind of feels like one. Sometimes it is the only way to know about local information. Unless an incident near you is reported by big organizations, it will probably only be on Facebook.

The problem is, Facebook has to filter all this information and put it behind an algorithm that is basically a black box.

One cannot be certain that Facebook will prioritize showing a crucial weather update rather than a really funny meme, a shocking revelation about a celebrity, or a new product. We all know which ones get the most reactions.

For example, sometimes I feel like people don't realize how dangerous an upcoming typhoon is because Facebook doesn't seem to amplify this sentiment enough. If only it knew how to emphasize how dangerous the typhoon could be, more people can be prepared. But instead, you see one post about an upcoming typhoon, scroll past it, see a new meme/product/scandal, and you forget about it.

## Messaging

Everyone uses Facebook Messenger to communicate in the Philippines. Unsurprisingly, it requires a Facebook account to use. So, if you need to abandon Facebook, you'll have to also disconnect from your relatives and friends. SMS messaging doesn't work because it is expensive.

Facebook Messenger is also used as a workplace messaging application. I know some who work on enterprises owned by Filipinos and they mostly communicate using Messenger.

## It is literally FREE to use Facebook in the Philippines

Since my high school days, mobile carriers have enabled access to Facebook and its services for free. It allowed us to view a simplified version of our Facebook news feeds and send messages for free. Literally no payment required. The only limitation was that you will not be able to see images. This strategy worked really well, as evidenced by how much we currently depend on this private service that is Facebook.

It feels like the presence of Facebook denied Filipinos of hand-crafted websites. 

I truly hope that by writing this, more people talk about this issue. I really want to encourage the government to start its own website for centralized information distribution. Filipinos deserve better.
