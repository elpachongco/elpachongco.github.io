## About this site

This site contains notes, thoughts, images and code by me (unless specified otherwise. Also, memes are excempted to this rule). The articles I write are mainly for my own reference. From time to time, I aim to reach an audience. It's also an excuse for me to call myself a writer.

## Design

I wanted this website to capture what it feels like to walk in the park.

To me, a park is an ideal environment to socialize, discover new things or just look around. I want the
visitors of this site to feel that way. I want to show interesting stuff to make it fun to look around.

## Why run a personal website

Running a website feels the same as owning a house. Probably.

A house has to be maintained, but since you own the house, you can do whatever you want with it. This
site is my own place in the internet. It's my own land in the pangea that is the internet.

I don't think there's an alternative to having your own website. I still use Facebook to connect with friends but
my thoughts mainly go here. I think it's safer to host content this way and my content is not limited to one
platform. I also like that I am not limited to what customizations I can do.

It's also just so good to tell people you have your own webiste, I feel like Tony Stark when I tell someone, 'oh I'm not really active on Facebook, but I'm active on my website'. In reality, the receiving end probably thinks I'm the kind of person who writes my own Wikipedia page, this feeling is probably heightened by the fact that they didn't ask.

## The technology of this blog

This is a static site is rendered by Hugo, hosted on Github Pages. It's written in plain CSS, and HTML. I have also installed `staticCMS` in my local copy of this website.

Previously, this site used the `Jekyll` theme `Ananke`. I customized it to fit a `shorts` section to the site. Today, it's using `letter`, a theme made by me for this site. By having my own theme, I am able to design and customize every part of this website.

### CMS

When I first started this blog, if I wanted to get my thoughts into the blog, there were bottlenecks, one is that there's no fast way to just type and publish a post. In Facebook, and Twitter, you're just one URL/bookmark away, and a button press to publish a new post. I found that I can run `StaticCMS` on my copy of this website to get the same, fast, user experience.

I've setup `hugo serve` with a cron job to run on startup so that everytime I have a thought I
want to publish, I can just open `localhost:1313/admin` to open `StaticCMS`. I think it's awesome.
