## About the author

I'm a software developer based in the Philippines. I like inventing stuff. I like seeing new things come from my work.

## Editor

I use Neovim with NVChad as my editor. I don't need a lot, I only write Python, and some JS and CSS for my day job.
In the past, I've used VSCode and Emacs. VSCode is nice but I hate that there are times where I'll need a mouse to use it.
I'm looking into getting back to using VSCode.

Emacs was nice, it was really customizable but it was just clunky. I'll oftentimes get random slowdowns even on 
an unconfigured Emacs.

## Tech

I like Python, it's the first programming language I learned. I build all prototype stuff in Python.
I also like CSS. I'm not good at it but I appreciate good CSS.

Apart from Python, I've tried to study C, and Go. Though, no big projects.
